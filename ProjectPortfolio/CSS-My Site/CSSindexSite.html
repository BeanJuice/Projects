      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p class = "intro">I love to learn! Developing & engineering my own coding solutions has become my biggest passion! I began learning to code because I saw how much the world around me relied on working
        programs to allow smooth work flow for every day operations. As soon as I realized code was all around me in my every day life, I fell in love with it!
        I am formally educated with a B. Sc. in Biotechnology, so the impact of programming stuck with me on a fundamental level. Also, being in healthcare for over a decade has opened my eyes to the scope
        and impact of cybersecurity and the general importance of the  IT & IS professions.</p>

        <h3>Python</h3>
        <p>Python was my first programming language, and I look forward to utilizing it in future projects for a long time to come.
          So far, I've written a few small project scripts, but continue to develop my skillset for increasingly complex tasks (e.g. network testing, automation, etc.).
          But my ultimate end goal is to apply my knowledge of Python as a penetration tester/CEH.</p>

        <h3>HTML & CSS</h3>
        <p>Learning these front end technologies really kept my momentum going after learning Python (full disclaimer: I never feel "finished" with learning Python).
          As project ideas keep flowing, I try to visualize my workflows and imagine the end UI and how I could critique it as a user myself.
          Both of HTML and CSS are essential to developing a quality UI. While each brings user interface and design challenges with them, they're a lot of fun to experiment with</p>
